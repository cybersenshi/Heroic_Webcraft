					<h3>The Request:</h3>
					<p>
					A site for SquareEnix-inspired folk rock band The World is Square.<br />
					Important features included ease of updates for a group that is more savvy with instruments than computers and being complete in time for debut at PAX East 2014.
					</p>
					<h3>The Project:</h3>
					<p>
					The Squares love some Japanese RPG video games, and so do I. So we decided to make the site look like something out of those games. With signature text styles, and posts with borders and backgrounds inspired by JRPG talk-boxes.<br />
					Tumblr was already a favorite platform for our intrepid band, so we decided to make the design into a Tumblr theme with a custom domain.<br />
					</p>
					<h3>Geeky Trivia:</h3>
					<p>
					The touring schedule is a set of custom text-fields on the Tumblr backend. All the easier for the band to make updates.<br />
					</p>
					<h3>See it in Action:</h3>
